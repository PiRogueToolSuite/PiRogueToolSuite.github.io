A network router is a device that facilitates communication between the internet and the devices in your home that connect to the internet. As its name implies, it &ldquo;routes&rdquo; traffic between devices and other networks, such as the internet. The PiRogue functions similarly to your ISP&rsquo;s router, allowing you to connect from one network to another by plugging it into the router using an Ethernet cable.</p><p>Since the PiRogue is intended for analyzing potentially compromised devices, it helps us separate those devices from the rest of our network. To achieve this, we will create a separate network in our lab, home, or hotel room.
When we connect a potentially compromised device to the PiRogue&rsquo;s Wi-Fi network, that device will not be able to see all the other devices connected to your network. This is important because when a device is compromised, there is a chance that any malicious software running on it will attempt to move and infect other devices connected to the same network. Therefore, we need to isolate the potentially compromised device from the rest of our network infrastructure and keep it away from other devices.</p><p>By creating a dedicated network to analyze a specific device, we can intercept network traffic solely from that device. This eliminates the noise caused by other devices communicating on the network and allows us to capture the network traffic from the device we want to analyze. We want to ensure that we capture the entire network traffic on this specific network, which is the WiFi network created by the PiRogue, without any interference from other devices.</p><p><strong>In this guide, we assume that we have a dedicated Wi-Fi network provided by the PiRogue and a potentially compromised device.</strong></p><p>When we want to analyze a potentially compromised device, we are uncertain about its activities, and further investigation, such as forensic analysis, may be challenging. After approximately three days, you can take your network traffic file and open it with Wireshark to start examining it for anything unusual or suspicious. For example, if you are a journalist located in Colombia and your device is communicating with a server located in Russia or India, it may raise concerns. Based on the profile of the person carrying this device, you will be able to mitigate risks and distinguish between legitimate network traffic and any suspicious traffic. Analyzing three days&rsquo; worth of network traffic can be overwhelming due to the significant amount of communication with various servers on the internet. Therefore, we need to filter out all non-legitimate traffic and look for anything that appears strange.
The PiRogue comes prepackaged with a tool called Suricata, a well-known tool. Suricata uses detection rules provided by security companies like ProofPoint, which are text files containing rules for detecting specific threats. The PiRogue updates these rules daily and utilizes them to feed Suricata for enhanced threat detection.</p><div class="alert alert-doks d-flex" role=alert><div class="flex-shrink-1 alert-icon">👉</div><div class=w-100>Please note that Suricata is designed to detect threats that are already known. However, it&rsquo;s important to understand that the absence of alerts does not guarantee that no malicious activity has occurred.</div></div><p>However, it is important to acknowledge that relying solely on a conclusion generated by a tool may not be entirely reliable, particularly if we suspect that the device itself has been compromised. In such cases, it becomes crucial to consider the context in which we are operating and evaluate our threat model. As a result, conducting network analysis becomes essential.</p><p>In the upcoming section, we will delve into the topic of analyzing network traffic using dedicated tools with PiRogue. If you find yourself less confident or experienced in performing the subsequent steps of network analysis, don&rsquo;t hesitate to seek assistance. Below is a list of organizations that can offer support:</p><ul><li><a href=https://www.hrw.org>Human Rights Watch</a></li><li><a href=https://www.accessnow.org/help/>AccessNow</a></li><li><a href=https://www.amnesty.org>Amnesty International</a></li><li><a href=https://www.civicert.org/help/>CiviCERT</a></li></ul><h2 id=connect-to-the-pirogue>Connect to the PiRogue <a href=#connect-to-the-pirogue class=anchor aria-hidden=true>#</a></h2><p>Before connecting the mobile device to the PiRogue Wi-Fi network, apply the following steps:</p><ul><li>enable airplane mode</li><li>disable mobile data and use Wi-Fi only</li><li>disable VPN if possible</li></ul><p>To begin capturing the network traffic, we need to connect the device to the PiRogue. If this is your first time connecting to the PiRogue, please refer to the <a href=https://pts-project.org/guides>first guide</a> for instructions.</p><p>Throughout this period, we will be using the tool <strong>tcpdump</strong> to capture the network traffic. After a duration of 3 days, we will retrieve the file containing all the captured network traffic. This file is typically named a <strong>PCAP</strong> file, which can be opened with tools like <strong>Wireshark</strong>.</p><p>Save the entire network traffic into a single file:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Command Line</th><th>Function</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><code>sudo tcpdump -i wlan0 -w example.pcap</code></td><td>Save the entire network traffic into a single file</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Now turn on the Wi-Fi connection of the device and connect to the PiRogue network.
Next on your computer, open the PiRogue’s dashboard by going to <code>http://&lt;PiRogue IP address>:3000</code> with your Web browser. Use the dashboard to get an overview of the network flow and potential alerts.</p><div class="alert alert-doks d-flex" role=alert><div class="flex-shrink-1 alert-icon">👉</div><div class=w-100>If necessary, check the guide explaining <a href=https://pts-project.org/docs/pirogue/operate-a-pirogue/>how to operate your PiRogue</a>.</div></div><p>Let it run for a few days (3 days) while keeping using the device.</p><p><strong>Why a few days?</strong> This is because malware and spyware often employ evasive tactics and strive to conceal their activities. Some of them communicate with remote servers only once or twice a day. By extending the duration of the capture, you enhance the likelihood of capturing relevant information.</p><h2 id=stop-the-capture-and-get-the-pcap-file>Stop the capture and get the PCAP file <a href=#stop-the-capture-and-get-the-pcap-file class=anchor aria-hidden=true>#</a></h2><p>To stop the capture, press <code>Ctrl + C</code> on your keyboard.
