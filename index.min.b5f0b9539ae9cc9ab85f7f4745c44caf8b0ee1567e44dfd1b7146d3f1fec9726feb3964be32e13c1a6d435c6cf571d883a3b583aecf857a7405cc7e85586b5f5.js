This means that it is constantly monitoring and inspecting the data packets that are being transmitted and received by these devices. The purpose of this analysis is to identify any suspicious or malicious activity that may be taking place on the network.
Two-pronged approach to network traffic analysis # The PiRogue employs two primary methods for analyzing network traffic: Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) and Suricata rule-based detection.
Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) # DPI is a technique that allows the PiRogue to examine the contents of data packets in detail. This includes information such as the source and destination IP addresses, the ports being used, the type of data being transmitted, and even the identification of the application involved. By analyzing this information, we can identify patterns and anomalies that may indicate malicious activity.
Suricata rule-based detection # Suricata is an open-source intrusion detection system (IDS) that uses a set of rules to identify known threats. These rules are constantly being updated to keep up with the latest threats. The PiRogue comes pre-configured with rules from ProofPoint Emerging Threat Open and Echap, two reputable sources of threat intelligence.
Visualizing analysis results in the dashboard # The results of the PiRogue\u0026rsquo;s automatic analysis can be visualized in the dashboard. This dashboard provides a graphical overview of the network traffic that has been analyzed, as well as any threats that have been detected. The dashboard also allows users to drill down into the details of specific network flows to learn more about them.
The dashboard # By default, your PiRogue exposes a Grafana dashboard showing in realtime the ongoing network connections, security alerts and few other information. Checkout the cheatsheet to get default user and password of the dashboard.

In the Internet tab, enable connection sharing as follows: We can connect the router in LAN via a cable, use the router in repeater mode, connect a 4G dongle or in connection sharing mode with a smartphone. It is this last option that interests us. After connecting the smartphone via USB, the router interface detects the device in the Sharing section with the usb0 device and proposes to connect the two devices. We establish the connection by clicking on Connect.
Once the connection is established, the router shows the network configuration with its IP address, the netmask, the default gateway and the default DNS server.
Get the PiRogue\u0026rsquo;s IP address # To be able to connect to your PiRogue dashboard, you need its IP address. To find it, just go to the Clients tab of the router\u0026rsquo;s administration panel to list all the devices connected to it. The PiRogue is indicated in the column Wired device with the name raspberrypi.
Finally, the PiRogue network is operational. You can connect to the PiRogue\u0026rsquo;s dashboard as you usually do just by browsing its IP address on port 3000 in your Web browser. The IP address is listed on the Clients page of the router, it should look like 192.168.8.xxx

MVT a.k.a Mobile Verification Toolkit is developed and maintained by Amnesty International. This tool is pre-installed on your PiRogue but not maintained by the PTS team.
Official documentation →
Preliminaries # Before using MVT, be sure to pull the IOCs from Amnesty International\u0026rsquo;s git repository.
To do so, on your PiRogue, run the following command
mvt-android download-iocs Forensic of an Android device # First of all, you have to connect the target device with USB to your PiRogue. On the device, you have to enable ADB in the Developer Settings. If the device is rooted, you should enable root for ADB only. On the Android device select Transfer files by taping on Android System - USB charging (in the list of notifications).
NB: all the following commands have to be executed on your PiRogue.
Then, run the following command:
adb devices It should give an output similar to:
* daemon not running; starting now at tcp:5037 * daemon started successfully List of devices attached 2[redacted]e device Before running MVT, you have to kill the ADB server
adb kill-server Finally, launch MVT and follow its official documentation.
Below is an example of use of MVT.
mvt-android check-adb -f -o mvt-demo It might produce an output similar to
Forensic of an iOS device # Prepare the iOS device to be analyzed # First of all, you have to connect the target device with USB to your PiRogue.
NB: all the following commands have to be executed on your PiRogue.
Once connected, start the USB mixer by running the following command
usbmuxd ⚠️ If usbmuxd is not found, install libimobiledevice. Run the following command
sudo apt install libimobiledevice-utils
The iOS device may be asking you if you trust the connected computer, trust it. Then, check if your iOS device is correctly recognized by running
ideviceinfo The previous command would print various information regarding your device.
Backup the iOS device # In order to get as many information as possible, you have to turn backup encryption on by running
idevicebackup2 backup encryption on -i Then backup the iOS device by running
idevicebackup2 backup --full backup/ Once done, you can unplug the iOS device. Run ls -l backup to get the name of the backup.
Analyze the backup # Run the following command to decrypt the backup
mvt-ios decrypt-backup -p \u0026lt;backup password\u0026gt; -d decrypted backup/\u0026lt;backup name\u0026gt; For more details and options, check the MVT documentation regarding the backup password. If you have backed up this phone using iTunes, the backup password is the same as the one you provided in iTunes.
Next, analyze the backup with mvt-ios
mvt-ios check-backup -o checked decrypted Finally, check the the results listed in the checked folder
ls -l checked The folder checked contains several JSON files. Any IOC matches are stored in JSON files suffixed by _detected.

Add your own suricata rules to PiRogue # You need:
SSH access to your PiRogue Github knowledge Optional: if you want access to ET PRO you would need your Oink code The easiest way to manage your Suricata rules is to have them on a Github repository or on a Web directory that can be checked out by suricata-update. Manually adding rules directly to the PiRogue is not recommended as it might get overwritten by an update.
Write your rules according to Suricata\u0026rsquo;s documentation. Bare in mind, the rules you want to write are alert ones. Set them up on a Github repository (or a Web directory) that can be reached by your PiRogue.
After being connected to your PiRogue.
Add your new source in this fashion:
sudo suricata-update add-source YOUR_NAME URL_TO_THE_DOT_RULES Run
sudo suricata-update update-sources and then
sudo suricata-update and your rules must be updated 🙂
Example with Abuse.ch SSL blocklist # If you want to add the Abuse.ch SSL blocklist, run the following commands:
sudo suricata-update add-source SSLBL https://sslbl.abuse.ch/blacklist/sslblacklist.rules sudo suricata-update update-sources sudo suricata-update Add an already published rule set such as ET Pro # While connected to your PiRogue: Run
sudo suricata-update enable-source et/pro insert your oink-code when prompted and finally run
sudo suricata-update update-sources sudo suricata-update In both cases, the PiRogue will grab the new version of your rules on a daily basis.

PiRogue comes with a pirogue-intercept-* helpers to help you intercept encrypted TLS traffic from applications, even in presence of TLS certificate pinning.
These helpers are meant to:
capture the network traffic instrument a specific application or any launched application Requirements # To follow this recipe, you need:
an up-to-date PiRogue a rooted Android device Procedure # First, SSH onto your PiRogue. Attach your smartphone to the PiRogue through USB and make sure \u0026ldquo;USB debugging\u0026rdquo; is on and working.
Make sure to enable ADB Transfer files by clicking on the Android System notification.
Your browser does not support the video tag. Then check if the PiRogue sees your device by running the command:
adb devices You should see your device listed. If not, be sure to use the right USB cable for your device. If the issue remains, check that you have the rights to interact with USB devices. To do so, run the command groups to list the groups you belong to and check if the group plugdev is listed. If not, execute the following command sudo usermod -aG plugdev $LOGNAME and reboot.
Identify and install the application # Android applications are identified by their package name. As an example, the French weather forecast application is fr.meteo. You can get the package name either from Google Play URL or from any tool analyzing Android apps such as Pithus, Virus Total, etc. In our example, the Google Play URL looks like https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=fr.meteo, the package name of the application is specified after id=.
Once you have identified the application you want to analyze, you have to download and install it on your target device. If you need to download the application from Google Play, we recommend to use apkeep (not installed by default on PiRogue).
Finally, to install the application, run the following command:
adb install \u0026lt;APK file\u0026gt; If your application contains multiple APKs (like in XAPK), use the command adb install-multiple \u0026lt;list all apks\u0026gt;.
Don\u0026rsquo;t launch the application.
Instrument and intercept # Once the application to be analyzed is installed on your Android device, connect your device to the PiRogue Wi-Fi network and run the following command:
sudo pirogue-intercept-gated -o \u0026lt;path to the output directory\u0026gt; Adapt the command according to your output directory of choice. Once started and showing Waiting for data, manually launch the application you want to analyze.
Now, interact with the application freely. When you are done interacting with the app, hit Ctrl+C on your keyboard to stop interception.
⚠️ Make sure that the application you want to be analyzed is not running in background. You can, for example, force stop it in Settings \u0026gt; Apps, select the application and click on Stop. Decrypt the traffic # If we run the previous command with sudo, we have to fix the permissions of generated files by running:
chown -R pi:pi \u0026lt;path to the output directory\u0026gt; Then enter the output directory with:
cd \u0026lt;path to the output directory\u0026gt; Next, we generate a PCAPNG file containing both the TLS keys and the captured traffic:
editcap --inject-secrets tls,sslkeylog.txt traffic.pcap decrypted.pcapng Next, we export the decrypted traffic in JSON:
tshark -2 -T ek --enable-protocol communityid -Ndmn -r decrypted.pcapng \u0026gt; traffic.json Finally, to view the decrypted traffic, run:
pirogue-view-tls -i traffic.json -t socket_trace.json ⚠️ The display of the stack trace has been added to pirogue-cli in version 1.0.5. Be sure to upgrade your PiRogue. If you face any issue, join the Discord channel to get help.
Generated files # The commands pirogue-intercept-single and pirogue-intercept-gated generate the following files:
aes_info.json contains all AES and RSA encryption/decryption operation with both cleartext and cyphertext device.json contains various information about the device such as IMEI, Android version experiment.json contains timing information such as the start and end date of the experiment screen.mp4 contains the video recording of the device\u0026rsquo;s screen socket_trace.json contains the stack trace of all operations on sockets (open, close, read, write\u0026hellip;) sslkeylog.txt contains the TLS encryption keys in the NSS key log format traffic.pcap contains the entire network traffic captured during the experiment NB: you can open the PCAP file with Wireshark and specify the key log file in Settings \u0026gt; Protocols \u0026gt; TLS. This way, Wireshark will automatically decrypt TLS traffic.

What is PiRogue # For a few months we have been testing PiRogue to perform network traffic analysis mainly on cell phones, so PiRogue becomes a super complete tool that contains many applications that help us to perform network traffic analysis, this hardware and software helps us to perform monitoring on intervention and network traffic.
One of the big challenges in forensic analysis is to know how to search the results, PiRogue deletes the data every 5 days for security reasons but to do a further analysis we need to extract the alerts and flows as a result of the analysis, to export the data we need to do the following steps.
How to export data # First, connect to your PiRogue with SSH:
ssh -p22 pi@\u0026lt;PiRogue IP address\u0026gt; Then, export alert data in a CSV file:
influx -database 'suricata' -execute 'SELECT * FROM \u0026quot;suricata\u0026quot;.\u0026quot;suricata_5d\u0026quot;.\u0026quot;alert\u0026quot;' -format 'csv' alerts-\`date +\u0026quot;%Y-%m- %d\u0026quot;\`.csv Export flow data too:
influx -database 'flows' -execute 'SELECT * FROM \u0026quot;flows\u0026quot;.\u0026quot;flows_5d\u0026quot;.\u0026quot;flow\u0026quot;' -format 'csv' flows-\`date +\u0026quot;%Y-%m- %d\u0026quot;\`.csv Finally, copy 2 generated CSV files from PiRogue to your computer using scp. On your computed, use the following command:
scp pi@\u0026lt;iRogue IP address\u0026gt;:\u0026lt;path of the CSV file\u0026gt; . Once you have retrieved your CSV files, you can open them with Excel, LibreOffice or any other software supporting CVS format.
Going further # The queries listed above are pretty simple but you can adapt them to your specific need, check out the influxdb documentation.
You can refine your request by filtering the following fields of the flows database:
