## Disclaimer
> Mobile Verification Toolkit (MVT) is a tool to facilitate the [consensual forensic analysis](https://docs.mvt.re/en/latest/introduction/#consensual-forensics) of Android and iOS devices, for the purpose of identifying traces of compromise.

> MVT's purpose is not to facilitate adversarial forensics of non-consenting individuals' devices. The use of MVT and derivative products to extract and/or analyse data originating from devices used by individuals not consenting to the procedure is explicitly prohibited in the license.

MVT *a.k.a* Mobile Verification Toolkit is developed and maintained by [Amnesty International](https://www.amnesty.org/en/). This tool is pre-installed on your PiRogue but not maintained by the PTS team.

[Official documentation â†’](https://docs.mvt.re/en/latest/) 

## Preliminaries
Before using MVT, be sure to pull the IOCs from [Amnesty International's git repository](https://github.com/AmnestyTech/investigations/).

To do so, on your PiRogue, run the following command
```bash
mvt-android download-iocs
```

## Forensic of an Android device
First of all, you have to connect the target device with USB to your PiRogue. On the device, you have to enable ADB in the *Developer Settings*. If the device is rooted, you should enable *root* for ADB only. On the Android device select **Transfer files** by taping on *Android System - USB charging* (in the list of notifications).

**NB**: all the following commands have to be executed on your PiRogue.

Then, run the following command:
```bash
adb devices
```
It should give an output similar to:
```text
* daemon not running; starting now at tcp:5037
* daemon started successfully
List of devices attached
2[redacted]e        device
```

Before running MVT, you have to kill the ADB server
```bash
adb kill-server
```

Finally, launch MVT and follow its [official documentation](https://docs.mvt.re/en/latest/android/methodology/).

Below is an example of use of MVT.
```bash
mvt-android check-adb -f -o mvt-demo
```

It might produce an output similar to

## Forensic of an iOS device

### Prepare the iOS device to be analyzed
First of all, you have to connect the target device with USB to your PiRogue. 

**NB**: all the following commands have to be executed on your PiRogue.

Once connected, start the USB mixer by running the following command
```bash
usbmuxd
```

{{< callout context="tip" title="Did you know?" icon="rocket" >}}
If `usbmuxd` is not found, install `libimobiledevice`. Run the following command 

```bash
sudo apt install libimobiledevice-utils
```
{{< /callout >}}

The iOS device may be asking you if you trust the connected computer, trust it. Then, check if your iOS device is correctly recognized by running
```bash
ideviceinfo
```
The previous command would print various information regarding your device.

### Backup the iOS device
In order to get as many information as possible, you have to turn backup encryption on by running
```bash
idevicebackup2 backup encryption on -i
```

Then backup the iOS device by running
```bash
idevicebackup2 backup --full backup/
```

Once done, you can unplug the iOS device. Run `ls -l backup` to get the name of the backup.

### Analyze the backup

Run the following command to decrypt the backup
```bash
mvt-ios decrypt-backup -p <backup password> -d decrypted backup/<backup name>
```

For more details and options, check the MVT documentation [regarding the backup password](https://docs.mvt.re/en/latest/ios/backup/libimobiledevice/). If you have backed up this phone using iTunes, the backup password is the same as the one you provided in iTunes.

Next, analyze the backup with `mvt-ios`
```bash
mvt-ios check-backup -o checked decrypted
```

Finally, check the the results listed in the `checked` folder
```bash
ls -l checked
```

The folder `checked` contains several JSON files. **Any IOC matches are stored in JSON files suffixed by `_detected`**.
