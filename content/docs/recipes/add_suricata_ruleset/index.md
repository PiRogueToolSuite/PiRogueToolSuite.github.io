## Add your own suricata rules to PiRogue

You need:
* SSH access to your PiRogue
* Github knowledge
* Optional: if you want access to [ET PRO](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-insight/et-pro-ruleset) you would need your Oink code

The easiest way to manage your Suricata rules is to have them on a Github repository or on a Web directory that can be checked out by `suricata-update`. Manually adding rules directly to the PiRogue is not recommended as it might get overwritten by an update.

Write your rules according to [Suricata's](https://suricata.readthedocs.io/en/suricata-6.0.0/rules/intro.html) documentation. Bare in mind, the rules you want to write are **alert** ones. Set them up on a Github repository (or a Web directory) that can be reached by your PiRogue.

*After being connected to your PiRogue.*

Add your new source in this fashion: 
```bash
sudo suricata-update add-source YOUR_NAME URL_TO_THE_DOT_RULES
```

Run 
```bash
sudo suricata-update
``` 
and then 
```bash
sudo suricatasc -c reload-rules 
```
and your rules must be updated and taken into account ðŸ™‚

### Example with Abuse.ch SSL blocklist
If you want to add the [Abuse.ch SSL blocklist](https://sslbl.abuse.ch/blacklist/sslblacklist.rules), run the following commands:
```bash
sudo suricata-update add-source SSLBL https://sslbl.abuse.ch/blacklist/sslblacklist.rules
sudo suricata-update
sudo suricatasc -c reload-rules 
```

## Add an already published rule set such as ET Pro

While connected to your PiRogue:
Run
```bash
sudo suricata-update enable-source et/pro
```
insert your `oink-code` when prompted and finally run
```bash
sudo suricata-update
sudo suricatasc -c reload-rules 
```

In both cases, the PiRogue will grab the new version of your rules on a daily basis.
