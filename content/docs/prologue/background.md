PiRogue Tool Suite project is the reboot of the PiRanhaLysis project. PTS is founded by Defensive Lab Agency with the financial support of Open Technology Fund. 

Defensive Lab Agency (DLA) is a French company founded in 2018 by Esther Onfroy with the objective of providing expert services on digital security and privacy issues. DLA is specialized in mobile security and focuses its work on supporting NGOs, activists, journalists, human rights defenders and public institutions against digital surveillance.

Since 2018, DLA's major public contributions were [reverse engineering of FinSpy Android for Amnesty International](https://defensive-lab.agency/2020/09/finspy-android/), conducting [privacy analysis of edtech mobile apps for Human Rights Watch](https://www.hrw.org/report/2022/05/25/how-dare-they-peep-my-private-life/childrens-rights-violations-governments) and hosting [mobile forensic online courses for Digital Defender Partnership](https://www.digitaldefenders.org/introduction-to-forensics-of-mobile-devices-identification-of-spyware-and-documentation-of-digital-threats-with-a-human-rights-and-gender-perspective/).

The services DLA specializes in are:

* **Reverse engineering of Android apps and malware**: this includes decompiling the app to its source code, analyzing the code for malicious behavior, and identifying its vulnerabilities. DLA can also help to develop secure Android apps by providing feedback on your code and recommending security best practices.

* **Consensual mobile forensic analysis**: DLA can investigate security incidents involving mobile devices. This includes extracting and analyzing data from mobile devices to identify evidence of malicious activity.

* **Mobile app privacy analysis**: DLA can help understand how mobile apps collect and process user data. This includes reviewing the app's privacy policy, analyzing the app's code, and testing the app's behavior. DLA can also help develop privacy-friendly mobile apps by providing recommendations on how to collect and process user data in a responsible manner.

* **Regulatory compliance audits of Android apps**: DLA can help ensure that apps comply with regulations, e.g. the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). This would require reviewing the app's privacy policy, analyzing the app's code, and testing the app's behavior.

* **Mobile security and forensic training**: DLA offers trainings to increase security awareness and practices. DLA also offers trainings on how to best take advantage of our open source tools.

The PTS project is developed and maintained by Esther Onfroy. Expert in information security and reverse engineering, Esther Onfroy, aka U039b, is a French hacktivist and lecturer.
