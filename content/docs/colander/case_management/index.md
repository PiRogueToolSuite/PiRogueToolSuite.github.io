## Overview

Case management is the overarching framework that organizes and oversees the entire digital investigation process, from the initial identification of a potential crime or incident to the final report and resolution. It serves as a central hub for coordinating all aspects of the investigation, ensuring that the investigation is conducted effectively and efficiently.

### Case folders
Comprehensive and well-structured case files serve as the backbone of any digital investigation. They should contain detailed information about the investigation, including the nature of the incident, relevant case documents, witness statements, electronic evidence, and any other relevant data. In Colander, everything is organized in cases. A case is defined by a name, a description and its confidentiality TLP and PAP levels.

### Timeline/Chronology
Establishing a clear and accurate timeline of events is crucial for understanding the sequence of actions taken and identifying potential patterns or relationships. This timeline should be built from various sources of information, including witness statements, electronic evidence, and communication logs. Among other types of entities, Colander allows describing events of different types. These events are then organized in a timeline.

### Collaboration
Effective communication and collaboration are essential for ensuring that all parties involved in the investigation are aware of the latest developments, progress is tracked, and potential roadblocks or issues can be promptly addressed. This includes sharing relevant information across departments, and facilitating communication between investigators, legal teams, and other stakeholders. In Colander, cases, and their entire content, can be shared with multiple teams of contributors. Only the owner of a team can invite new collaborators, to do so, the owner has to ask each user their contributor ID. This way, users can refuse being added to a given team.
