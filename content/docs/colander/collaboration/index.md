# Teams
Teams in Colander are the only way to share cases with other users. To create a team, go in *Colander* > *Collaborate* > *Teams* and give a name.

Once created, click on *Details* to add a contributor. Since a Colander instance can host multiple users from different organizations, users cannot search for another user by their name. Instead, the owner of the team has to ask other users for their *Contributor ID*. This way, they are free to decide whether they want to share their ID or not. The *Contributor ID* can be found in user's profile.

{{< callout context="caution" title="Ownership" icon="alert-triangle" >}}
Only the owner of the team can:
* edit the team
* delete the team
* add or remove contributors 
{{< /callout >}}


# Share a case
Only the owner of a case can share it with a team they are either owner or contributor. To share a case with one or multiple teams, simply edit the case and select/deselect the teams you want to share the case with.
