title: "Organize dropped files"
---
In your Colander *drop zone*, you can review and assign cases to the files you have dropped. To do so, select one or multiple files and click *Review*. This will open a wizard and simply follow the few steps. Once converted into *Artifacts*, you can see your dropped files directly in the list of artifacts within the case you have selected.
