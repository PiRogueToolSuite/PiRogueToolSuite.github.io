title: "Get your Colander API credentials"
---

1. Connect to your Colander server
2. Go to your user profile (top right header user link)
3. Write down `API key` and `API url`

`API url` and `API key` will be used later in this cookbook to configure Colander Companion.

* `API url` and `API key` are private and sensitive information
* Keep them secret (e.g: do not share them through untrusted messaging app)
