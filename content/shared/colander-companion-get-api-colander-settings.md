title: "Get your Colander API information"
---

1. Connect to your Colander server
2. Go to your user profile information (top right header user link)
3. Write down `API Key` and `API Url`

`API Url` and `API Key` will be used later in this cookbook to configure Colander Companion.

* `API Url` and `API Key` are private and sensitive information
* Keep them secret (e.g: do not share them through untrusted messaging app)
