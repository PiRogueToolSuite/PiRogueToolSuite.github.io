In some cases, it's crucial to [time stamp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trusted_timestamping) collected files to securely keep track of the creation and modification time of a file. PiRogue uses an external timestamping authority. To do so, run the following command on your PiRogue:

```shell {title="Securely time stamp files"}
pirogue-timestamp -c [folder containing the files to time stamp]
```

The command generates a file `hashes.txt` listing the `sha512` hash of every files contained in the specified folder and generates the following files:
* `README.md`: the file containing the verification instructions
* `freetsa.org_cacert.*`: the certificate of the timestamping authority
* `hashes.txt`: the file listing the `sha512` hash of the timestamped files
* `hashes.txt.tsq`: the time stamp query
* `hashes.txt.tsr`: the time stamp reply

In this example, we time stamp the files contained in the folder `drop`.
