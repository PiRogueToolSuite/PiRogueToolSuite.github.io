We're thrilled to announce a major milestone in the evolution of Colander, our digital investigation web platform for civil society organizations. After months of dedicated work, we've completely revamped our deployment procedure, making it easier than ever to get Colander up and running, keep it updated, and ensure your data is safe. The key to this transformation? A collection of [Ansible](https://docs.ansible.com/) playbooks!

For those unfamiliar, Ansible is a powerful open-source automation tool that simplifies complex IT tasks. By leveraging Ansible, we've created a streamlined and robust deployment experience for Colander. This means less manual configuration, fewer potential errors, and more time for you to focus on what matters.

These playbooks automate everything, from installing dependencies to deploying the platform.

* **Easy Deployment:** Get Colander up and running quickly.
* **Simplified Updates:** Keep Colander current with the latest features.
* **Robust Backups:** Protect your valuable data.
* **Consistent & Reliable:**  Predictable deployments across environments.

Ready to try it out? Find the playbooks and instructions at [https://pts-project.org/docs/colander/deployment/](https://pts-project.org/docs/colander/deployment/). We'd love to hear your feedback! This is a big step towards making Colander as accessible and user-friendly as possible, and we've more exciting updates coming soon.
