Dr. Gillian “Gus” Andrews has spent the last decade supporting security, privacy, and software usability in digital human rights organizations. She has helped improve the usability of a number of open-source tools, including Thunderbird, Mailpile, and Tahoe-LAFS/GridSync, as well as the CC-licensed security guide Security in a Box. Her work at the intersection of human-computer interaction and digital security has spanned both the tech industry and civil society NGOs, and her research has shaped policy decisions in both governments and the Electronic Frontier Foundation. She has been a panelist on the digital rights radio show “Off The Hook” and an organizer for the Hackers On Planet Earth conference. 

Dr. Andrews is the author of *Keep Calm and Log On* ([keepcalmlogon.com](https://www.keepcalmlogon.com/), MIT Press 2020), a guide to surviving the digital revolution for everyday citizens.
