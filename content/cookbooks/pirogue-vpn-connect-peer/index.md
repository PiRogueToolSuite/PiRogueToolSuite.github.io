* **Remove VPN peer configurations:** Delete on the PiRogue and on peer's devices, any VPN peer configurations as soon as they're no longer needed.
* **Handle peer configurations with care:** Peer configurations contain sensitive information. Share them securely and privately.
* **PiRogue's IP address exposure:** Online services accessed through the VPN can see your PiRogue's IP address.
