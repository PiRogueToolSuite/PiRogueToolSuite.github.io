PiRogue tool suite is a reboot of the [PiRanhaLysis project](https://piranhalysis.github.io/). We decided to reboot the project to make it easier to use and community driven.

PiRogue tool suite is mainly developed and maintained by [Defensive Lab Agency](https://defensive-lab.agency) in the person of [Esther Onfroy](https://esther.codes). She is an expert in Android security and reverse engineering. Esther Onfroy a.k.a U039b is a French hacktivist, speaker and co-founder of Defensive Lab Agency, Exodus Privacy, Echap, PiRogue tool suite and Pithus. She works with journalists, academics, NGOs and private companies. She helps them better understand and respond to today's cybersecurity threats on mobile devices.
