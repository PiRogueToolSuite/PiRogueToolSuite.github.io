On a daily basis, we encounter potentially malicious applications in various forms. They can appear as seemingly harmless apps we intend to download from Google Play (although it's rare -- Google usually takes them down), or they may be disguised as links or APK files shared within chat groups, especially if we are human rights defenders operating in a high-surveillance environment. Additionally, these malicious applications can be found on compromised devices.

In this guide, we will explore how to deal with applications, primarily focusing on Android applications, that raise suspicion of being potentially malicious.

Some Android malware masquerades as a normal application. Those files are called APKs (Android Application Package), and the very large majority of your Android applications are APKs.

Because Google Play adds some information to most of the APKs when they are uploaded to the Play Store, it is possible to check for applications that come from it. This modification is called *frosting*. When you find an APK that is not frosted, you'd need to be extra careful with it. There are chances it is malicious.
