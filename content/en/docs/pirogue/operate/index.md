## Find your PiRogue on the network
Once your PiRogue is running, it will be accessible to you from the network. There are 2 ways to get the IP address of your PiRogue. 

**The first way** is by looking at the screen of the PiRogue Hat.

**The second way** is to use the `ping` command. To do so, on your computer connected to the same network as your PiRogue, run the following command:

```bash
ping -c1 pirogue.local
```

Example of output, in this example, the IP address of the PiRogue is `192.168.0.16`:
```text
PING pirogue.local (192.168.0.16) 56(84) bytes of data.
64 bytes from pirogue.home (192.168.0.16): icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=0.319 ms

--- pirogue.local ping statistics ---
1 packets transmitted, 1 received, 0% packet loss, time 0ms
rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 0.319/0.319/0.319/0.000 ms
```

## The dashboard
By default, your PiRogue exposes a [Grafana](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/basics/) dashboard showing in realtime the ongoing network connections, security alerts and few other information. Checkout the [cheatsheet]({{< relref "cheatsheet" >}}) to get default user and password of the dashboard. 

[Open your dashboard →](http://pirogue.local:3000) 

Depending on your network configuration, this link above may not work. If so, check how to get the IP address of your PiRogue in the previous section.

The default dashboard is composed of different panels, we will go through the main ones.
