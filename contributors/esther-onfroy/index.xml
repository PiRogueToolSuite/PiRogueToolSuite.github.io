Main PiRogue capabilities # The PiRogue is an open hardware device based on a Raspberry Pi operating as a network router (like any ISP router) analyzing network traffic in real time.</description></item><item><title>Beginner guide - How to capture and analyze device's network traffic</title><link>/guides/g2/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/guides/g2/</guid><description>To begin, let&amp;rsquo;s explain first what we are doing here:
We will be using the PiRogue as a network router. A network router is a device that facilitates communication between the internet and the devices in your home that connect to the internet. As its name implies, it &amp;ldquo;routes&amp;rdquo; traffic between devices and other networks, such as the internet. The PiRogue functions similarly to your ISP&amp;rsquo;s router, allowing you to connect from one network to another by plugging it into the router using an Ethernet cable.</description></item><item><title>Beginner guide - How to handle a potentially malicious mobile app</title><link>/guides/g3/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/guides/g3/</guid><description>On a daily basis, we encounter potentially malicious applications in various forms. They can appear as seemingly harmless apps we intend to download from Google Play (although it&amp;rsquo;s rare &amp;ndash; Google usually takes them down), or they may be disguised as links or APK files shared within chat groups, especially if we are human rights defenders operating in a high-surveillance environment. Additionally, these malicious applications can be found on compromised devices.</description></item><item><title>Beginner guide - How to backup a mobile device for forensic analysis purpose</title><link>/guides/g4/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/guides/g4/</guid><description>Creating a backup of a mobile device is a crucial and standard procedure in forensic analysis. It provides us with a secure and unaltered copy of the data, enabling a thorough and reliable investigation.
The backup ensures that we have a copy of the data that can be analyzed without affecting the original evidence of a potentially compromised device. Mobile device backups contain a partial copy of the filesystem, including user data and service databases.</description></item><item><title>Monthly report n⁰26 - 2024-03</title><link>/blog/monthly-report-n26-2024-03/</link><pubDate>Sun, 31 Mar 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/monthly-report-n26-2024-03/</guid><description>What we have done so far # You can check out our work on GitHub at https://github.com/PiRogueToolSuite/ or on our website at https://pts-project.org/.
PiRogue # We fixed a bug in the pirogue-dashboard package that occurred when connecting from Cuba. In fact, due to US restrictions, the PiRogue is unable to to download Grafana plugins. The fix was quite simple since the only plugin the package relies on is no longer needed since it has been introduced in the Grafana distribution.</description></item><item><title>Monthly report n⁰25 - 2024-02</title><link>/blog/monthly-report-n25-2024-02/</link><pubDate>Thu, 29 Feb 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/monthly-report-n25-2024-02/</guid><description>What we have done so far # You can check out our work on GitHub at https://github.com/PiRogueToolSuite/ or on our website at https://pts-project.org/.
PiRogue # We are still in the process of freezing all the features of PiRogue. No major features or breaking changes, except for fixing bugs, will be introduced until March 2024.
We fixed a bug occurring on certain devices running Android 13 when retrieving the screen recording. This is now fixed in the package pirogue-cli version 1.</description></item><item><title>Monthly report n⁰24 - 2024-01</title><link>/blog/monthly-report-n24-2024-01/</link><pubDate>Wed, 31 Jan 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/monthly-report-n24-2024-01/</guid><description>Context of the project # PiRogue Tool Suite is a reboot of PiRanhaLysis project. Today, PiRanhaLysis is used by a variety of users ranging from universities (e.g. the University of Yale), activists and NGOs, and received lot of interest. Too much traction in fact to be maintained in our spare time, as we have done until now. Currently, the project is at the proof-of-concept stage. To get to a wider adoption by the general public, we need to streamline the build process and smooth the interface.</description></item><item><title>Monthly report n⁰23 - 2023-12</title><link>/blog/monthly-report-n23-2023-12/</link><pubDate>Sun, 31 Dec 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/monthly-report-n23-2023-12/</guid><description>Context of the project # PiRogue Tool Suite is a reboot of PiRanhaLysis project.
