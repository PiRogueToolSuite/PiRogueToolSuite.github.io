PiRanhaLysis serves different use-cases, ranging from universities (the University of Yale as an example), activists, NGOs and although archived, still gets a lot of traction. In fact, too much traction for it to be maintained as a hobby project as it has been done until now. Currently, PiRogue Tool Suite is at the proof-of-concept stage. To get to wider adoption by the general public, the build process must be streamlined and the interface smoothened.</description></item><item><title>Monthly report n⁰7- 2022-08</title><link>/blog/monthly-report-n7-2022-08/</link><pubDate>Wed, 31 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/monthly-report-n7-2022-08/</guid><description>Context of the project # PiRogue Tool Suite is a reboot of PiRanhaLysis project.
