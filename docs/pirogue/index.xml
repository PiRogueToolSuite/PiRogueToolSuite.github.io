It can operate in different modes:
an on-the-field mode
for emergency response (active spying, device tampering, &amp;hellip;) useful for responders in repressive environment conduct forensics analysis and network detection using a pre-installed set of tools an expert mode for technical people to:</description></item><item><title>Build a PiRogue</title><link>/docs/pirogue/build-a-pirogue/</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/docs/pirogue/build-a-pirogue/</guid><description>The hardware you need # In addition to a computer and an Internet connection, you will need, at least, a Raspberry Pi (+ its power supply), a SD-card and an ethernet cable.

How the PiRogue configuration works # PiRogue features come in Debian packages, each package manages some system configuration files:
the package pirogue-ap creates the wi-fi access point, it manages: /etc/hostapd/hostapd.conf /etc/dnsmasq.conf /etc/dhcpcd.conf /etc/iptables/rules.v4 /etc/iptables/rules.v6 the package pirogue-dashboard creates the dashboard, it manages: /etc/grafana/grafana.</description></item><item><title>Upgrade a PiRogue</title><link>/docs/pirogue/upgrade-a-pirogue/</link><pubDate>Wed, 17 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/docs/pirogue/upgrade-a-pirogue/</guid><description>All PiRogue features are bundled in Debian packages. So, by upgrading Debian (which is the only supported operating system) you are also upgrading your PiRogue.
To upgrade both the OS and the PiRogue features, run the following two commands:
sudo apt update sudo apt dist-upgrade This operation could take some time and would require a reboot to make your PiRogue operates properly.
How often should I upgrade my PiRogue # We advice you to upgrade your PiRogue weekly.</description></item><item><title>Operate a PiRogue</title><link>/docs/pirogue/operate-a-pirogue/</link><pubDate>Sat, 07 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/docs/pirogue/operate-a-pirogue/</guid><description>Find your PiRogue on the network # Once your PiRogue is running, it will be accessible to you from the network. There are 2 ways to get the IP address of your PiRogue.
The first way is by looking at the screen of the PiRogue Hat.
The second way is to use the ping command. To do so, on your computer connected to the same network as your PiRogue, run the following command:</description></item><item><title>Cheatsheet</title><link>/docs/pirogue/cheatsheet/</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/docs/pirogue/cheatsheet/</guid><description>Default configuration # Name Value Example of usage SSH port 22 ssh -p22 pi@&amp;lt;PiRogue IP address&amp;gt; SSH user pi SSH password raspberry Dashboard port 3000 http://&amp;lt;PiRogue IP address&amp;gt;:3000 Dashboard user admin Dashboard password PiRogue Wi-Fi SSID PiRogue1 Wi-Fi password superlongkey Chronograph port 8888 http://&amp;lt;PiRogue IP address&amp;gt;:8888 To see your configuration, run
