These structured representations of knowledge, akin to semantic networks, connect entities and their interrelationships, providing a cohesive framework for comprehending the intricacies of digital environments.
At the heart of knowledge graphs lies a network of interconnected nodes, each representing a distinct entity.</description></item><item><title>ðŸš§ External sources</title><link>/docs/colander/external-sources/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/docs/colander/external-sources/</guid><description/></item><item><title>ðŸš§ Collaboration</title><link>/docs/colander/collaboration/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/docs/colander/collaboration/</guid><description/></item><item><title>ðŸš§ Artifact management</title><link>/docs/colander/artifact-management/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/docs/colander/artifact-management/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Chain of custody</title><link>/docs/colander/chain-of-custody/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/docs/colander/chain-of-custody/</guid><description>In the intricate domain of digital forensics, maintaining confidentiality is paramount to protect sensitive information and ensure the integrity of investigations. Two widely adopted confidentiality frameworks, Traffic Light Protocol (TLP) and Permissible Actions Protocol (PAP), provide structured guidelines for sharing and restricting access to sensitive data. These frameworks empower digital forensic practitioners to navigate the delicate balance between information sharing and confidentiality.
